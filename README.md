How to Play:

after you compiled 2048.py


Click "Play" button to begin a new game



Use left,right,up,down key to control the direction of blocks



By doing that above,



make blocks that bear the same number mixed and rejoin a biger number.



Every singal move would increase 2 blocks bearing 2 or 4 at random



The goal:



Get a block that bears 2048



If before achieving goal,the space has been filled and can't do any step,U failed


ATTENEION:



Only when you get the final-result(win_or_lose) and then exit


system would save your highest-score

P.S.Sometimes the game may get some error

(have a very low probability b'cause I hav'nt seen it in reseased version)

Don't worry

That's because a bug in python 3.5,the version that I use

Restart it would be fine

Have A Nice Time! :-)
